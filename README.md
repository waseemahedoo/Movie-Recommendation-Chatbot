# 🎬 Movie Recommender Chatbot

A conversational movie recommender system that combines **SentenceTransformer embeddings**, **LLM-powered query rewriting**, and a **Streamlit chatbot interface** to provide relevant movie suggestions based on user intent.

> 🧠 Powered by Mistral-7B-Instruct (via `transformers`) + `intfloat/e5-base` for semantic similarity

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ **LLM-based query understanding**  
  Uses Mistral 7B to rewrite vague or complex user messages into focused movie search queries.

- ✅ **Semantic search with vector embeddings**  
  Movie descriptions are embedded using `intfloat/e5-base` and compared to user intent via cosine similarity.

- ✅ **Multi-turn conversation awareness**  
  The chatbot remembers recent user queries and rewrites them in context (e.g. "I want something sad but inspiring").

- ✅ **Streamlit chatbot UI**  
  Clean and interactive front-end to simulate a real-time recommendation dialogue.
